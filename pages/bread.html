<h2>Easy Beginner Bread Recipe</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons and 1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2-1/4 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees F</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until bubbles form on surface</li>
      <li>Whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, salt and 3 cups flour.</li>
      <li>Stir oil into yeast mixture; pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth</li>
      <li>Stir in enough remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, to form a soft dough.</li>

      <li>Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.</li>
      <li>Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half. Shape each into a loaf.</li>
      <li>Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.</li>
      <li>Bake at 375° until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an internal temperature of 200°, 30-35 minutes. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.</li>
